# asteroids
Asteroids using the Processing library.
Pretty sure you gotta install Processing for this to work.

It's just asteroids - the game. In Java. With an invisible asteroid.
It's a bug, but I think that it gives it some charm.


Also, when you die, stars fly out in all directions. They look pretty cool, since they're imperfect stars (it's drawn in randomized ranges around the points of a typical star).
That was probably the funnest part of the project.
